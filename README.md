Repo for week 4 challenge assignment

In this PyCity Schools challenge 2 files of data were merged into one.  With the merged files several summaries were created to help read the data and draw conclusions.  Two conclusion from the data include District schools overall passing percentage scores are in the 50-54% percentile range while Charter schools have a significantly higher score for overall passing percentage ranging from 89-92%.  Another conclusion from the data is that the more money spent per student for the schools budget has a negative correlation to overall passing percentage.  The higher volume schools average the lowest overall passing percentage scores.
